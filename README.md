# PyPanorama
a really basic tool for creating swipeable panoramas for Instagram written in Python

PyPanorama was written in Python 3 using the PIL library for image processing. I created this for my own use, but I thought that I would upload it here. 

# Usage
place your panorama image into the directory of the program and name it panorama.jpg 
run the program (requires admin)
select the options you want and then the program will generate a folder and place the output pics there
